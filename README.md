# purge_mac: free up some RAM

This is a simple script, but it's useful.  

PROBLEM: 
At the end of a day of school and work, unecessary processes hog my Mac's RAM.  I got tired of rebooting in order to kill those processes and have a clean RAM slate.
  
SOLUTION: 
This AppleScript uses the 'purge' command to accomplish the same thing, without having to open a shell (Terminal) window.

NOTE: I use [Alfred][http://www.alfredapp.com/] to quickly execute this script.
